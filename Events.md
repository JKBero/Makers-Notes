Job hunting:

Negotiating salary increase:
- Know your worth - research market rates and speak to peers
- Back it up. Also be comfortable with not over-selling; leave it in their hands. You can provide reasons when asked.
- The hirer won't be offended
- Record your learning and achievements. Go over it with your manager
- Get constant feedback; are you meeting their expectations?
- Use job offers as leverage
- You have to walk away from a job sometimes if there is no compromise or undervalued

Move from Junior to Mid:
- Look back over your learning records; be encouraged by your progress
- Be open with your manger; get their support
- Speak to colleagues/mentors/peers; what do you need to work on?

Tech tests & interviews:
- Ask questions
- Practise
- Don't be afraid to fail; request feedback; learning opportunity

Career mistakes:
- *Be open with your mistakes. Don't hold yourself or your team back. Ask for support.*

### Inheriting a tech organization
Rahma Javed - Director of Engineering @ Deliveroo   

- Continue to build on and maintain the social capital you were hired on.
- Self awareness; mindful of strengths & weaknesses. Hire the right people to fill those gaps.
- Identify peopel to achieve your goals:
  - allies
  - potentials
  - silent audience - perhaps leave these until blockers are dealt with. They are not doing harm in the meantime.
  - blockers - be careful to identify and then make a plan, decide on how long/fast to deal with them.
- Gender gap in leadership - you are playing the game with rules you never got to set
- Have the backing of your leadership behind you
