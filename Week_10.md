# Week 10

[Approach](#approach) | [Review 1](#review-1)

## Goals  

*Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code? (Well tested, easy to read, easy to change.)*

Secondary goals:  

- Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
- Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.

## Review 1

**Feedback**   
*Projects/Week10/report_system*
- Solid TDD process - great small steps and simplest solutions
- Great use of inputs and outputs table, which I then based my testing on
- Strong debugging with getting visibility
- Implementation to be improved
  - add more ```if``` statements for simplest solution
  - refactor after red-green and develop an algorithm to generalise
  - can hardcode in your strings once added more ```if``` statements
  - don't remove existing code without proving it's tested; comment out existing code and see if it still passes with the new refactor
- How often to commit? He advised after every red-green cycle, and after every large refactor (up to me to determine).
