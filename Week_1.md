# Week 1

[Day 1](#day-1)  |  [Day 2](#day-2)  |  [Day 3](#day-3)  |  [Day 4](#day-4)  |  [Weekend Challenge](#weekend-challenge)

**1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods**

**2. Pair using the driver-navigator style**

**3. Follow an effective debugging practice**

**4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP**

## Day 1

### Debugging workshop  

Use: error message
1. Understand the problem (don’t take stabs in the dark)
2. Fix it

Bugs:
- Syntax Error; compiler (e.g. IRB) doesn’t know what went wrong
- Runtime Error; name error (haven’t declared the variable)
- Program not terminating; infinite loop / code hangs
- Unexpected results

Tighten the loop = find the right line  
Get visibility = use ‘p’ to get visibility on each line  
Follow the stack trace

### Reflection with pair partner (Boris Bike):  

#### 1. TDD
- We were diligent and methodical with writing tests before production code
(red-green-refactor).  

#### 2. Pairing
- We stayed positive and celebrated small successes
- We were patient with each other and allowed for different approaches /
experimentation. We did not interrupt each other
- We were both assertive with our ideas / explained concepts to each other
- We switched navigator / driver frequently
- ! Can improve on taking breaks more frequently

#### 3. Debugging
- Followed the stack trace
- Tried to identify the issue methodically
- We remained calm when we did not understand the source of the bug
- We googled and asked for help where appropriate   

### Gaps in knowledge to revisit:
- feature tests
- user stories -> Domain Model
- rspec syntax

## Day 2

### Goal Setting
- do some practicals
- review extra resources from yesterday's pairing project
- explain concepts outloud to someone  

| Knowledge gap | Resources read | Practicals/projects | Explain it outloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feature tests vs user test | - [Boris Bikes Step 3 resources](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/3_from_domain_models_to_feature_tests.md)|
| user stories -> Domain Model | - [Boris Bikes Step 2 resources](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/2_working_with_user_stories.md) |
| rspec syntax | - [Boris Bikes Step 8 resources](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/8_back_to_the_unit.md)|
| debugging -> using the stack trace | - [Boris Bikes Step 4 resources](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/4_errors_are_good.md) |

### Gaps in knowledge to revisit:
- [BDD cycle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/bdd_cycle.md)
