[Day 1](#day_1)  |  [Day 2](#day_2)  |  [Day 3](#day_3)  |  [Day 4](#day_4)

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style

3. Follow an effective debugging practice

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Day 1

Reflection with pair partner (Boris Bike):  

1. TDD
- We were diligent and methodical with writing tests before production code
(red-green-refactor).  

2. Pairing
- We stayed positive and celebrated small successes
- We were patient with each other and allowed for different approaches /
experimentation. We did not interrupt each other
- We were both assertive with our ideas / explained concepts to each other
- We switched navigator / driver frequently   

3. Debugging
- Followed the stack trace
- Tried to identify the issue methodically
- We remained calm when we did not understand the source of the bug
- We googled and asked for help where appropriate   

### Gaps in knowledge to revisit:
- feature tests
- user stories -> Domain Model
- rspec syntax
