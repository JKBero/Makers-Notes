## Rails Q&A

### Folder conventions
Folder examples
- 'Rails new'
- Barebone project scaffolders
- Open source projects
- Official docs
- High quality blogs (e.g. Thoughtbot blog)

### Controller testing
- Most of the behaviour you may as well cover in your feature tests
- A unit test should have ideally one expectation
- A feature test, is more accepted to have several expectations

### Other tips for early on
- Play around generating new rails items early on, to figure out what is being changed / created in the folder structure
- A new controller is needed when a new database is introduced
- Decorators (similar to helpers) are useful when drying up your views
- Focus on feature tests
- Think about flow from a user's perspective
