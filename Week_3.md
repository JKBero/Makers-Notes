[Day 1](#day-1) | [Day 2](#day-2) | [Day 3](#day-3) | [Day 4](#day-4) | [Day 5](#day-5) | [Weekend Challenge](#weekend-challenge) | [Gaps in Knowledge](#gaps-in-knowledge) 



---------

## Day 1

### Goal Setting
- Would like to fully refactor my Takeaway weekend project at some point; and write the README

### Code review
- avoid hardcoding (hard to extend)
- don't use the instance variables in testing - i.e. it's testing state
  - just test the expected output
- third party code -> in Messenger class, put "client" in initialize so we can use doubles in our tests

### Pairing
- Made good progress in intro to the web (HTTP, URL etc...)
- thoroughly enjoying Sinatra
- building on understanding of view and controller

----------

## Day 2

### Goal Setting
- Attend process modelling workshop; practised modelling HTTP process in teams (see [workshops](https://github.com/JKBero/Makers-Notes/blob/master/Workshops.md))

### Pairing (Battle project)
- Intro to the model; redirection in controller and get/post
- My partner had a very different navigator/driver style. The navigator would tell the driver exactly what they'd like typed/achieved, and then you switch. It worked well because our boundaries and respect were strong, but I could imagine it could get trickier if there was a personality who wanted to 'navigate' while they navigated and drove, drowning out the other person.
- Would also like to try the ping-pong style when it is a broader project without set instructions; one person writes test, second person writes the code to pass, refactor and then writes next test, and switch.

----------

## Day 3

### Goal Setting
- Attend Empathy workshop ((see [workshops](https://github.com/JKBero/Makers-Notes/blob/master/Workshops.md))
  - Practice active listening more
  - Research Metta Bhavana meditation (seems the personal benefits are very similar to prayer)
- Finish Server practical
