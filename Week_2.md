**1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)**  

**2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage**  

**3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking**  

**4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)**  

**5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback**
