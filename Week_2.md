**1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)**  

**2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage**  

**3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking**  

**4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)**  

**5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback**

## Feedback workshop  

= Info about something / someone / behaviours, **which is used as a basis for improvement**

#### Why is it difficult?
**Love & Acceptance VS Learning & Growth**

- Questioning motivation
- Not all are trained / learnt the skill
- Not wanting to hurt someone (empathy or perhaps backlash)
- Fear of not being accepted
- Hard to receive, as perhaps very self-critical / feel threatening
- Hard to receive, as perhaps you have ego / pride
- Fear based behaviours

6 core needs:
Love
Acceptance
Learning
Growth
?
?

#### How can we make it easier?
1. Shift your perspective
- Do not view it as positive or negative... NEUTRAL (something to help YOU grow)
- See it as something kind
2. Emprowered receiver
- Ask for it; be eager and specific; pairing culture / team culture
- Gatekeeper
- As a receiver FB helps us understand ourselves, profile, blind-spots #freetherapy
- helps us practice assertiveness, boundaries, cultivate authentic and equal relationships
- Improve work life and overall quality of life
3. Know thyself
- 3 feedback triggers:  
  1. Truth trigger - seems wrong or off target
  2. Relationship triggers - something about our relationship with the person
  3. Identity triggers - undermines how we see ourselves ("Google bias")
4. Wrong-spotting - our default mindset is looking for what is wrong first
5. We all have blind spots

#### Building resilience
- What is your happiness set point? http://www.happiness-survey.com/
- Meditation increases your baseline happiness
- Swing: How wide do you swing?
- Recovery / Sustain: How long does it take for you to return to your baseline happiness? (minutes / hours / days...)

#### Understand feedback
- Appreciation - to acknowledge, connect, motivate, reassure, thank
- Evaluation - to rate or rank against a set of standards, aling expectation, inform decision-making
- Coaching - to help receiver expand knowlede, sharpen skill, improve capability

#### Use a framework
A - actionable (avoid adjectives like "good"/"bad")
S - specific (avoid stories; use hard facts)
K - kind (being direct can also be kind)

Communication stances - check your energy first.
- Doormat - openly agreeable, people-pleasing behaviour
- Sword - steamrolling, dominating, aggressive - doesn't create safe space for others
- Lantern - ask questions, drop assumptions

NVC (Non-Violent Communication)  

| Expression |
| ---- |
| Observation: When I see/hear.... |
| Feeling: I feel... |
| Need: Because I need... |
| Request: Would you be willing...? |

- know your feelings
- know your needs

- ask permission to give feedback, respect boundaries
- state the purpose of you FB
- give specific feedback
- be direct and respectful
- read someone's state

- Weigh it carefully; you can reject it if it's right to do so
- Strive for learning in the feedback

**Ultimately, it's all to help you grow and improve**

- Weigh it carefully; you can reject it if it's right to do so
- Strive for learning in the feedback
