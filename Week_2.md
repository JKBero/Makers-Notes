**2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage**  

**3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking**  

**4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)**  

**5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback**

## Feedback workshop  

= Info about something / someone / behaviours, **which is used as a basis for improvement**

**Why is it difficult?**
Love & Acceptance VS Learning & Growth

- Questioning motivation
- Not all are trained / learnt the skill
- Not wanting to hurt someone (empathy or perhaps backlash)
- Fear of not being accepted
- Hard to receive, as perhaps very self-critical / feel threatening
- Hard to receive, as perhaps you have ego / pride
- Fear based behaviours

6 core needs:
Love
Acceptance
Learning
Growth
?
?

Feedback is everywhere - about building resilience

How can we make it easier?
1. Shift your perspective
- Do not view it as positive or negative... NEUTRAL (something to help YOU grow)
- See it as something kind
2. Emprowered receiver
- Ask for it; be eager and specific; pairing culture / team culture
- Gatekeeper
- As a receiver FB helps us understand ourselves, profile, blind-spots #freetherapy
- helps us practice assertiveness, boundaries, cultivate authentic and equal relationships
- Improve work life and overall quality of life
3. Know thyself
- 3 feedback triggers:  
 1. Truth trigger - seems wrong or off target
 2. Relationship triggers - something about our relationship with the person
 3. Identity triggers - undermines how we see ourselves ("Google bias")
- Wrong-spotting - our default mindset is looking for what is wrong first
- We all have blind spots
4.
5.

- Read someone's state

| What are instance variables and how are they different from local variables? | | | |
| What are exceptions in Ruby? Why do they have messages associated with them? | | | |
