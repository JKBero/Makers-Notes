# Week 7
 
**Week's goals:**
- Build a front-end app in Javascript
  - Can you write a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript?
  - As part of this primary goal, a sub-goal should be that you are able to explain and give an example of asynchronous behaviour in Javascript
- Work competently in Javascript
- Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript
- To help you towards your primary goal, your secondary goal will be to produce a diagram of how all the parts of your notes app interact.
  - Your diagram might include: model, view, controller, external API, browser page, unit tests, feature tests, static server, node, XMLHttpRequest, the DOM.

Concepts
- Frontend, single page web apps.
- Events and event handlers.
- Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Ajax.
- Frontend templating.
- Frontend routing.

------------------

Goals:
- Attend JS event loop workshop
- Attend JS module pattern workshop
- Attend Github CV workshop
- Attend talk on Ag Tech
- Create JS front-end note web app

See [workshops](https://github.com/JKBero/Makers-Notes/Workshops.md) for full workshop notes.  
Ag Tech notes on mobile.  
Personal CV notes on mobile.  

Questions for coaches/research:
- When are closures useful (as in the example in public/private methods in Ellie’s notes - week7.md)?
- ```(this)``` is sometimes used and ```()``` is sometimes used - when is each relevant? Ask re ```exports```
- If you’re using constructor/prototype, why do you have to wrap this in an extra layer of the module pattern?. Not 100% sure about the privacy provisions.
