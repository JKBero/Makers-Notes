*Antonio C:*  

I’ve had a bit of a strange first job (at the company where I currently still am);
as I ended up being in a team of two and not really doing programming the ‘makers way’. 
However I stuck with the company, as they provided me with mentoring, training and so forth, 
and now I have moved to a team where I actually do what I call ‘more serious programming’.  

- Don’t rush your decision, whenever you get offered a job: 
take your time to make sure it’s the best fit for you; look for a place that cares about you and your development, 
and is willing to “invest” on you (e.g. offer you training/conference allowance, provide mentoring).

- Keep an open mind: I wanted to work in a specific industry (health tech), however, when I finished makers, 
I wasn’t really able to find companies that would have helped me progress and support my development 
(I work in ad tech now, but my next move is hopefully going to be finding a job in health tech).

- This is not the easiest thing to do (especially after a long day at work), but try and code/read about computer science, 
software development in your spare time.

- Whenever you’re asked to do a tech test, just make sure that what they ask you to do is 
something “feasible” for someone coming out of a bootcamp 
(I was once asked to develop a full stack app, with even a specific front end design in 3 days, 
for a job that had a below average pay): some companies do like to take the mick out of you.

The careers team of Makers is amazing, so don't worry at all. It can be a bit overwhelming because 
they can book many interviews in the same week, so if you feel too much pressure let them know and 
focus on the jobs that you like the most!   

* Daniel A:*  

I'm only a couple of weeks into my first role, but I've found there isn't an overbearing expectation on me. 
I'm having to pick up a new framework (Angular) so have spent all my time so far working through tutorials 
and building small projects.
