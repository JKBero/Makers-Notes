## Alumni Advise

*Antonio C:*  

I’ve had a bit of a strange first job (at the company where I currently still am);
as I ended up being in a team of two and not really doing programming the ‘makers way’. 
However I stuck with the company, as they provided me with mentoring, training and so forth, 
and now I have moved to a team where I actually do what I call ‘more serious programming’.  

- Don’t rush your decision, whenever you get offered a job: 
take your time to make sure it’s the best fit for you; look for a place that cares about you and your development, 
and is willing to “invest” on you (e.g. offer you training/conference allowance, provide mentoring).

- Keep an open mind: I wanted to work in a specific industry (health tech), however, when I finished makers, 
I wasn’t really able to find companies that would have helped me progress and support my development 
(I work in ad tech now, but my next move is hopefully going to be finding a job in health tech).

- This is not the easiest thing to do (especially after a long day at work), but try and code/read about computer science, 
software development in your spare time.

- Whenever you’re asked to do a tech test, just make sure that what they ask you to do is 
something “feasible” for someone coming out of a bootcamp 
(I was once asked to develop a full stack app, with even a specific front end design in 3 days, 
for a job that had a below average pay): some companies do like to take the mick out of you.

The careers team of Makers is amazing, so don't worry at all. It can be a bit overwhelming because 
they can book many interviews in the same week, so if you feel too much pressure let them know and 
focus on the jobs that you like the most!   

*Daniel A:*  

I'm only a couple of weeks into my first role, but I've found there isn't an overbearing expectation on me. 
I'm having to pick up a new framework (Angular) so have spent all my time so far working through tutorials 
and building small projects.   

*Rebecca P: (MoJ)*    

Tech Stack: We're mainly a ruby house, which is lovely coming from Makers! There are projects done is lots of other bits and bobs, everything from VBA to python, but ruby is the main one that we tend to user in interviews for back end devs.   

Culture: So in terms of culture, it's a nice vibe especially for juniors, I was allowed to pick up a bit of everything and they helped me a lot (or left me alone when I told them I needed to work it out myself), I will say all of this varies from team to team though, it's all about who is on your team and how they are.   

I think for juniors it's a lot about if you have the basics down, it's very in line with makers! Do you test things, can you understand a problem/task given to you, how do you work through difficult things, what are your learning strategies.    

We have a whole things about civil service competencies and success frameworks that we adhere to when we hire people. They're all available online, but I think they are: Setting direction, creating engagement and delivering results. They for thing that demonstrate these things in the interview. So if you've taught someone else something or done a presentation (at makers or before) it could be worth a mention. Oh and I don't know if they've done STAR technique with you at makers Situation task action result way of answering interview questions. It's what they tell people to try to use in an interview.    

I heard the adverts are meant to be going out soon for juniors (I think they're aiming to have interviews etc. by March so hopefully they'll be along soon!
